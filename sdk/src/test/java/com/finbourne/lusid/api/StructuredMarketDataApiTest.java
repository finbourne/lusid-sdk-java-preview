 * LUSID API
 * # Introduction  This page documents the [LUSID APIs](https://www.lusid.com/api/swagger), which allows authorised clients to query and update their data within the LUSID platform.  SDKs to interact with the LUSID APIs are available in the following languages and frameworks:  * [C#](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-csharp) * [Java](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-java) * [JavaScript](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-js) * [Python](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-python) * [Angular](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-angular)  The LUSID platform is made up of a number of sub-applications. You can find the API / swagger documentation by following the links in the table below.   | Application | Description | API / Swagger Documentation | | ----- | ----- | ---- | | LUSID | Open, API-first, developer-friendly investment data platform. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/api/swagger/index.html) | | Web app | User-facing front end for LUSID. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/app/swagger/index.html) | | Scheduler | Automated job scheduler. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/scheduler2/swagger/index.html) | | Insights |Monitoring and troubleshooting service. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/insights/swagger/index.html) | | Identity | Identity management for LUSID (in conjuction with Access) | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/identity/swagger/index.html) | | Access | Access control for LUSID (in conjunction with Identity) | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/access/swagger/index.html) | | Drive | Secure file repository and manager for collaboration. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/drive/swagger/index.html) | | Luminesce | Data virtualisation service (query data from multiple providers, including LUSID) | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/honeycomb/swagger/index.html) | | Notification | Notification service. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/notifications/swagger/index.html) | | Configuration | File store for secrets and other sensitive information. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/configuration/swagger/index.html) |

For each id LUSID will return the most recent matched item with respect to the provided (or default) effective datetime.                 An optional maximum age range window can be specified which defines how far back to look back for data from the specified effective datetime.  LUSID will return the most recent item within this window.                In the request each structured market data id must be keyed by a unique correlation id. This id is ephemeral and is not stored by LUSID.  It serves only as a way to easily identify each item in the response.                The response will return three collections. One, the successfully retrieved structured market data. Two, those that had a  valid identifier but could not be found. Three, those that failed because LUSID could not construct a valid identifier from the request.    For the ids that failed to resolve or could not be found a reason will be provided explaining why that is the case.                It is important to always check the failed and not found sets for any unsuccessful results.
