 * LUSID API
 * # Introduction  This page documents the [LUSID APIs](https://www.lusid.com/api/swagger), which allows authorised clients to query and update their data within the LUSID platform.  SDKs to interact with the LUSID APIs are available in the following languages and frameworks:  * [C#](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-csharp) * [Java](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-java) * [JavaScript](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-js) * [Python](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-python) * [Angular](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-angular)  The LUSID platform is made up of a number of sub-applications. You can find the API / swagger documentation by following the links in the table below.   | Application | Description | API / Swagger Documentation | | ----- | ----- | ---- | | LUSID | Open, API-first, developer-friendly investment data platform. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/api/swagger/index.html) | | Web app | User-facing front end for LUSID. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/app/swagger/index.html) | | Scheduler | Automated job scheduler. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/scheduler2/swagger/index.html) | | Insights |Monitoring and troubleshooting service. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/insights/swagger/index.html) | | Identity | Identity management for LUSID (in conjuction with Access) | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/identity/swagger/index.html) | | Access | Access control for LUSID (in conjunction with Identity) | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/access/swagger/index.html) | | Drive | Secure file repository and manager for collaboration. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/drive/swagger/index.html) | | Luminesce | Data virtualisation service (query data from multiple providers, including LUSID) | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/honeycomb/swagger/index.html) | | Notification | Notification service. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/notifications/swagger/index.html) | | Configuration | File store for secrets and other sensitive information. | [Swagger](https://www.lusid.com/configuration/swagger/index.html) |

/**
 * Pricing context node. In order to price an instrument a number of configuration parameters are required to determine which  (a) pricing model (ranging from a simple lookup of a market quote/price through to a Monte-Carlo simulation for the behaviour of its cashflows)  (b) vendor library (Lusid internal models or those provided through an external Vendor such as Refinitiv (proprietary) or QuantLib (open source)  are used in the pricing.    In conjunction with these there are a number of parameters that govern the behaviour of these models. For example, in pricing an Fx volatility  dependent product such as an Fx option, there are various parameters that affect model behaviour for the smile. In Lusid a distinction is made between  those which are understood natively and those which are only held for use with a given vendor-model combination. The problem is that, unlike market  quote data, there are few standards around model descriptions. Hence, apparently similar terminology can be mis-leading; for example in SABR models where  the basic parameters are agreed upon but most practical models have used an approximation with adjustments where the parameters can have wildly different meanings.  To avoid confusion or mis-behaviour in this area, where parameters are not understood to be interchangeable, they are only settable on a per-library per-model  basis, essentially as opaque data that will be given to the Vendor library \&quot;verbatim\&quot; but not used with any other.
