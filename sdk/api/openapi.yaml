    # Introduction

    This page documents the [LUSID APIs](https://www.lusid.com/api/swagger), which allows authorised clients to query and update their data within the LUSID platform.

    SDKs to interact with the LUSID APIs are available in the following languages and frameworks:

    * [C#](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-csharp)
    * [Java](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-java)
    * [JavaScript](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-js)
    * [Python](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-python)
    * [Angular](https://github.com/finbourne/lusid-sdk-angular)

    The LUSID platform is made up of a number of sub-applications. You can find the API / swagger documentation by following the links in the table below.

    a parent transaction portfolio (though it can also contain its own transactions),
    enabling different modelling strategies to be devised, among other operations.
    Note that a derived transaction portfolio is a type of portfolio, so endpoints
    in the TransactionPortfolios API and the Portfolios API can also be called. For

  name: Structured Result Data
- description: LUSID is a transaction-based system. Every transaction in a particular
    instrument should belong to a transaction type in order that it might contribute
    to measuring your holding (position) in that instrument. Transaction types are
    a fundamental building block of LUSID, and care should be exercised when changing
    them. For more information, see https://support.lusid.com/knowledgebase/article/KA-01872/.
  name: System Configuration
- description: A transaction portfolio stores transactions and calculates instrument
    holdings and cash balances, enabling valuation, analytic, profit & loss, risk
    assessment and other operations to be performed. Note that a transaction portfolio
    is a type of portfolio, so endpoints in the Portfolios API can also be called.

        \          \r\nNote that grouping can affect the quantity of information returned;\
        \ where a holding is an amalgamation of one or more (e.g. cash) instruments,\
        \ a unique\r\ntransaction identifier will not be available. The same may go\
        \ for diagnostic information (e.g. multiple sources of an aggregate cash amount\
        \ on a date that is\r\nnot split out. Grouping at the transaction and instrument\
        \ level is recommended for those seeking to attribute individual flows.\r\n\
        \            \r\nIn essence this is identical to the 'GetCashFlows' endpoint\
        \ but returns the cash flows as a set of transactions suitable for directly\
        \ putting back into LUSID.\r\nThere are a couple of important points:\r\n\
        (1) Internally it can not be fully known where the user wishes to insert these\
        \ transactions, e.g. portfolio and movement type.\r\n    These are therefore\
        \ defaulted to a sensible option; the user will likely need to change these.\r\
        \n(2) Similarly, knowledge of any properties the user might wish to add to\
        \ a transaction are unknown and consequently left empty.\r\n(3) The transaction\
        \ id that is added is simply a concatenation of the original transaction id,\
        \ instrument id and payment date and direction. The user can happily override\
        \ this."

      description: "If it is desired to have multiple recipes, there is a strong likelihood\
        \ that they will share various components.\r\nA configuration recipe snippet\
        \ allows a user to define a set of rules that can then be included into a\
        \ parent recipe.\r\nThis allows sharing of common blocks of the recipe.\r\n\
        \            \r\nFor example, a user might define a set of rules for resolving\
        \ Fx and then include them into every recipe used firm-wide, thereby\r\nenforcing\
        \ consistency. As the rules can be permissioned differently using Shrine,\
        \ it is possible to enable users to \r\nread but not alter such a rule set.\r\
        \n            \r\nThe same applies to a set of pricing rules.\r\n        \
        \    \r\nA configuration snippet must only contain one entry from the available\
        \ set. \r\n            \r\nRecipes are compiled from the set of snippets through\
        \ a model that is analogous to inheritance.\r\nA recipe can have a set of\
        \ 'parent' recipes from which it inherits. These are specified in the inheritance\
        \ section of a recipe.\r\nUpon loading, the recipe will fall back on these\
        \ recipe components for any options or rules that are not explicitly specified\
        \ in the\r\nnamed recipe for the request.\r\n            \r\nThis allows control\
        \ of pricing to be harmonised across a set of desks within an institution.\
        \ Suppose that, e.g.\r\nthere are four desks looking after products under\
        \ the areas of Fx, Rates, Credit and Exotics.\r\nThe model and market data\
        \ for pricing given asset types would potentially be controlled by the appropriate\
        \ desk; e.g. rules for Fx market data resolution being\r\ncontrolled by the\
        \ Fx desk. The exotics desk would likely depend upon rules for all the other\
        \ asset classes as well as, say, correlation rules of its own.\r\nIt could\
        \ inherit the market data and model rules from the other desks for finding\
        \ the appropriate institution-standard data and then overlay that with the\
        \ correlation rules.\r\n            \r\nNote that permissioning of the store\
        \ means that one could decide that only a particular desk or control function\
        \ could update certain rules. That would assist the abilitiy\r\nto ensure\
        \ that pricing is performed consistently and provide an audit of changes made\
        \ to it along with restricting changes to appropriate authorised functions."

        \ Monte-Carlo simulation for the behaviour of its cashflows)\r\n(b) vendor\
        \ library (Lusid internal models or those provided through an external Vendor\
        \ such as Refinitiv (proprietary) or QuantLib (open source)\r\nare used in\
        \ the pricing.\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with these there are a number of parameters\
        \ that govern the behaviour of these models. For example, in pricing an Fx\
        \ volatility\r\ndependent product such as an Fx option, there are various\
        \ parameters that affect model behaviour for the smile. In Lusid a distinction\

        \ but most practical models have used an approximation with adjustments where\
        \ the parameters can have wildly different meanings.\r\nTo avoid confusion\
        \ or mis-behaviour in this area, where parameters are not understood to be\
        \ interchangeable, they are only settable on a per-library per-model\r\nbasis,\
        \ essentially as opaque data that will be given to the Vendor library \"verbatim\"\
        \ but not used with any other."
